## 1. Executive Summary

The global digital advertising market suffers from **opacity, high intermediary costs, and rampant fraud**. Small publishers struggle to monetize effectively, advertisers overspend without transparency, and end-users rarely share in the value they generate.

**Adescentralized** is a decentralized advertising platform powered by the **Stellar blockchain**.
It enables advertisers, publishers, and end-users to interact in a **transparent, trustless ecosystem** where:

* **Advertisers** can create campaigns with clear budgets and targeting rules.
* **Publishers** (website owners) can easily integrate ads via our **JavaScript SDK** and receive automatic payouts in XLM.
* **End-users** are rewarded with tokens for their verified interactions (impressions and clicks).

This creates a **fairer distribution of value** across the advertising chain while reducing fraud through on-chain verification and automated micropayments.

In one sentence:
**Adescentralized makes advertising fair, transparent, and decentralized â€” powered by Stellar smart contracts.**

---

## 2. Problem Statement (Ideation & Value Proposition)

### The Market Problem

* **Fraud**: Up to 30% of online ad traffic is invalid, draining billions from advertisers annually.
* **Opacity**: Advertisers have little visibility into where their money goes, and publishers cannot verify fair distribution.
* **High Intermediary Costs**: Centralized ad networks charge significant fees, reducing publishersâ€™ revenue share.
* **End-User Exclusion**: Users generate the data and attention that power ads but are rarely compensated.

### Target Audience

* **Advertisers**: Brands, startups, and agencies looking for cost-efficient and transparent ad campaigns.
* **Publishers**: Website owners, bloggers, and platforms seeking additional monetization streams.
* **End-users**: Individuals who interact with ads and can be incentivized to participate fairly.

### Value Proposition

Adescentralized delivers value through:

* **Transparency**: All payments and rewards are recorded on Stellarâ€™s blockchain.
* **Fair Revenue Share**: Publishers receive up to 70% of ad spend directly, without middlemen.
* **User Rewards**: End-users earn XLM for verified impressions and clicks.
* **Micropayments at Scale**: Stellar enables fast, low-cost transactions, unlocking real-time payouts.
* **Anti-Fraud Mechanisms**: Smart contracts and cooldown logic reduce click-farming and fraudulent activity.

Our solution transforms the ad ecosystem into a **trustless, transparent, and incentive-aligned model**, leveraging Stellarâ€™s capabilities to solve a real-world billion-dollar problem.

## 3. Solution Overview

Adescentralized is structured as a **modular ecosystem**, where each component interacts seamlessly to guarantee transparency, fairness, and automation:

### ðŸ”¹ Core Components

1. **Smart Contracts (Soroban, Stellar):**

   * Handle advertiser deposits into a secure vault.
   * Automate distribution of rewards to publishers and end-users.
   * Enforce anti-fraud rules (cooldowns, verified impressions).

2. **Backend Services (Node.js APIs):**

   * Manage campaigns, sites, and user accounts.
   * Record impressions/clicks and trigger contract calls.
   * Provide analytics dashboards for advertisers and publishers.

3. **Publisher Host Frontend (React):**

   * Dashboard for publishers to register websites, generate SDK snippets, and track revenue.

4. **JavaScript SDK:**

   * Lightweight script integrated into publisher websites.
   * Loads ads, tracks impressions/clicks, and communicates with backend/contract.
   * Supports multiple formats (small banners, responsive ads).

5. **Browser Extension (Optional for Users):**

   * Allows end-users to opt-in to see ads.
   * Provides real-time notifications of rewards credited to their Stellar wallet.

6. **Example Website:**

   * Demonstrates end-to-end SDK integration and payment flow.

### ðŸ”¹ User Flows

#### Advertiser Flow

1. Creates campaign â†’ Defines budget in XLM, cost per click, and targeting tags.
2. Deposits funds into **AdVault smart contract**.
3. Ads are automatically distributed to matching publishers.
4. Receives real-time analytics (impressions, CTR, spending).

#### Publisher Flow

1. Registers website on host dashboard.
2. Generates SDK snippet and embeds in site.
3. Ads are served automatically, with impressions and clicks recorded.
4. Stellar contract pays publisher share in near real-time.

#### End-User Flow

1. Browses a participating website or extension.
2. Views or clicks ads.
3. Smart contract verifies the action and distributes XLM directly to userâ€™s wallet.

## 4. Blockchain Applicability

Adescentralized is **built for Stellar** â€” the blockchain is not an add-on, but the **core enabler** of the solution.

### Why Stellar?

* **Micropayments at Scale:** Stellar enables transactions as low as \$0.00001 with finality in 3-5 seconds. This makes **per-impression payouts** feasible for the first time.
* **Soroban Smart Contracts:** Campaign funds are locked in the AdVault contract, ensuring that advertisers only pay for **verified interactions**, and publishers/users are paid automatically.
* **Transparency & Auditability:** Every payment and campaign interaction can be traced on-chain, eliminating hidden fees or manipulation.
* **Inclusion:** Stellarâ€™s mission of **financial access** aligns perfectly with rewarding users worldwide, especially in emerging markets.

### Current Implementation

* Contracts are compiled in Rust â†’ WebAssembly (WASM) and deployed on **Stellar Testnet**.
* Campaign creation, site registration, and reward flows are fully tested against testnet contracts.
* End-to-end demo integrates SDK, backend APIs, and Soroban smart contracts.

### Future Scalability

* Migration to **Stellar Mainnet** for production-grade use.
* Integration with **Anchors** for fiat on/off ramps, enabling advertisers to fund campaigns in local currency while publishers/users are paid in XLM.
* Extension into mobile SDKs (React Native, Flutter) to expand ad distribution beyond websites.

In summary: **without Stellarâ€™s speed and low fees, our model of per-impression, per-click micropayments would not be economically viable.** Blockchain is not just applicable, it is essential.

## 5. Real-World Potential

### Market Opportunity

* The **digital advertising industry** is projected to surpass **\$678 billion by 2025**.
* Small and medium businesses (SMBs) represent a massive underserved segment, struggling with **high CPCs** and **lack of transparency**.
* Publishers and creators often lose **30â€“45% of ad revenue** to intermediaries, while end-users remain excluded from value distribution.

### Why Adescentralized Matters

* **For Advertisers:** Lower costs, fraud reduction, and verifiable campaign performance.
* **For Publishers:** Higher direct revenue, instant payouts, and full transparency.
* **For Users:** A share of ad value, creating financial inclusion while respecting privacy.

### Scalability & Viability

* **Micropayment Model:** Stellarâ€™s efficiency allows **per-view payments**, a model that traditional payment rails cannot sustain.
* **Global Reach:** Works across borders with **multi-currency paths** supported by Stellar.
* **Business Model:**

  * 0.5% transaction fee on payouts (competitively below existing networks).
  * Premium analytics and reporting for advertisers.
  * API monetization for third-party integrations.

### Beyond the Hackathon

* **Adoption Roadmap:**

  * MVP live on Stellar Testnet.
  * Pilot programs with niche publishers (blogs, indie news sites).
  * Integration with fiat on/off ramps for advertiser convenience.
  * Expansion into influencer marketing and mobile SDKs.
* **Long-Term Vision:** To become a **new standard for transparent advertising**, reducing fraud and empowering users globally, especially in **emerging markets**.

### 7.4 Contract Surface (Soroban)

* **AdVault**

  * `create_campaign(advertiser, params)` â†’ `campaign_id`
  * `fund(campaign_id, amount)` â†’ lock XLM
  * `debit(campaign_id, amount)` â†’ accrue spend
  * `settle(campaign_id)` â†’ on-chain split (publisher %, user %), emit tx hashes
* **Token**

  * `transfer(from, to, amount)`
  * `balance_of(address)`
* **Registry**

  * `register_publisher(addr, meta)`
  * `register_user(addr, meta)`
* **Events**

  * `record_view(campaign_id, view_hash, pub_id, user_hash, ts)` (idempotent)
  * Emits logs that index event IDs (auditable trail)

> **Invariants:** no double-spend; budget caps enforced; idempotent event recording; access control (advertiser, publisher, admin).

### 7.5 Core API Surface (Selected)

* `/v1/campaigns` `POST|GET|PATCH`
* `/v1/sites` `POST|GET|PATCH`
* `/v1/events/impression` `POST`
* `/v1/events/click` `POST`
* `/wallet` `POST /login /balance /transfer`
* `/analytics/*` aggregate metrics (CTR, RPM, spend, revenues)

**Cross-cutting**

* **Auth**: JWT/Passkeys (UI) + HMAC or Idempotency-Key (SDK events)
* **Validation**: payload schemas; replay protection; rate limits for `/events/*`

### 7.6 Data Model (Simplified)

```
campaigns(id, advertiser_id, status, budget_total, budget_locked, cpc, tags[], created_at)
sites(id, publisher_id, domain, revenue_share, status, created_at)
events(id, type{impression|click}, campaign_id, site_id, user_hash, ts, valid, signals_json)
payouts(id, campaign_id, period, publisher_amount, user_amount, fee_amount, tx_hash, ts)
users(id, role{advertiser|publisher|user}, email?, stellar_address, created_at)
```

* **Signals stored** in `events.signals_json` (viewability %, dwell time, focus/blur, pointer activity).
* **Privacy**: `user_hash` is rotated/pseudonymized.

### 7.9 Security Boundaries

* **Edge**: WAF + strict CORS; HSTS; TLS only.
* **APIs**: schema validation; rate limits; idempotency for event ingestion; replay protection.
* **SDK**: minimal data, no cross-site tracking; debug mode gated.
* **Contracts**: access controls; budget ceilings; non-reentrancy by design; event idempotency.
* **Secrets**: KMS/SSM; no secrets in images.
* **Privacy**: pseudonymized user identifiers; data minimization; retention windows.

### 7.10 Observability & SLOs

* **Golden signals**: RPS, p95 latency, 5xx rate, valid/invalid event ratio, settlement lag.
* **Tracing**: request â†’ validation â†’ contract call â†’ ledger confirm.
* **Dashboards**: campaign spend, CTR, RPM, payouts/time.
* **SLO examples**:

  * Ingest latency (impression â†’ stored): p95 < 200 ms
  * Settlement trigger to ledger finality: p95 < 10 s (testnet)
  * Event acceptance error rate: < 0.5% (over 5 min)

## 8. Technical Deep Dive

This section covers **key APIs** and **contract methods** with practical examples for developers and judges.

### 8.1 Smart Contracts (Soroban)

#### AdVault Contract

Handles campaign budgets, event validation, and payouts.

* `create_campaign(advertiser, budget, cpc, tags[])`

  * **Input:** advertiser address, budget in XLM, CPC, targeting tags.
  * **Output:** `campaign_id`.

* `fund(campaign_id, amount)`

  * Advertiser deposits funds.
  * Emits `DepositEvent`.

* `record_event(campaign_id, event_type, site_id, user_hash)`

  * Called when an impression or click is validated by backend.
  * Updates campaign budget.
  * Emits `EventRecorded`.

## 9. Business Model & Monetization

Adescentralized sustains itself through a **lightweight fee model** designed to be competitive and scalable.

### 9.1 Revenue Streams

| Source               | Description                                                                          | % Revenue Contribution |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Transaction Fee**  | 0.5% fee on advertiser â†’ publisher/user payouts (lower than Google/Facebookâ€™s \~30%) | \~70%                  |
| **Premium Features** | Advanced dashboards, reporting, fraud analytics                                      | \~10%                  |
| **API Access (B2B)** | Charging NGOs, fintechs, or employers who embed SDK at scale                         | \~20%                  |

### 9.2 Competitive Advantage

* **Lower Costs:** Transaction fee <1% vs 20â€“45% cut from traditional ad networks.
* **Micropayments:** Enabled only by Stellarâ€™s low-fee infrastructure.
* **Trust:** On-chain verification replaces opaque ad-tech intermediaries.

### 9.3 Scalability

* **Global Reach:** Stellar anchors allow advertisers to fund campaigns in fiat, while payouts remain in XLM.
